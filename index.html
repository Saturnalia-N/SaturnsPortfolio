            <p>I am currently studying Computer Science at UH Hilo.<br>
			 I've always been very intrested in art and i would have pursued it for a carrier if the job industry was not as bad with AI.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy drawing both traditional and digital art! I put a lot of my art on Instagram and TikTok, Although I have not reached too many people im glad for those who support my work!</p>
			<p>The drawing above was drawn by @almarts27 on Instagram!</p>
